# Formik Form Validation in React

This project demonstrates how to use Formik in a React application for performing validation on a simple login form. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Install the necessary packages using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.

The application provides a simple form with two fields, email and password. Upon submitting the form, it validates whether the fields are filled out and whether the email is in the correct format. If the validation passes, it will display a "Login Successful" message in an alert box.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run several commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Libraries Used

- [Formik](https://formik.org/): Formik is used for handling form state and validation in the application.
